__#Secret Diary Project#__


##Project Ouline##

###SecretDiary###
  - lock
  - unlock
  - add_entry
  - get_entries

###__User Stories__###

Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.

When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.

When the user calls `lock` again they throw errors again.

##__Spec__##

First organise it into one class only.

Then, when all your tests are green, reorganise it into classes with high cohesion.

This will also involve reorganising your tests!
